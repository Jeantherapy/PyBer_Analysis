# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of the PyBer ride data is to provide information and insights about the rides taken within the PyBer ride-sharing service. The PyBer ride data includes details such as the city, date, fare amount, number of drivers, and city type (urban, suburban, or rural). Here are the list of deliverables
* Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
* Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
* Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

### Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
The PyBer ride data can be used to analyze ride patterns and trends over time. This analysis enables the prediction of future ride demand, helping PyBer optimize driver allocation, pricing strategies, and operational planning.

###  Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
The city type information in the PyBer ride data allows for market segmentation analysis. This analysis can help PyBer understand the different characteristics and behaviors of riders in urban, suburban, and rural areas, leading to targeted marketing campaigns and tailored service offerings.

### Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)
Based on the provided PyBer ride data, here is a summary of the key insights that can be derived:

1. Total Rides by City Type: The total number of rides can be calculated for each city type (urban, suburban, and rural). This provides an understanding of the ride demand and usage in different areas.

2. Total Drivers by City Type: The total number of drivers can be calculated for each city type, offering insights into the availability of drivers in different areas and potential driver-to-rider ratios.

3. Total Fares by City Type: The total amount of fares collected can be calculated for each city type, indicating the revenue generated in different areas and the contribution of each city type to PyBer's overall financial performance.

4. Average Fare per Ride by City Type: By dividing the total fares by the total number of rides, the average fare per ride can be calculated for each city type. This metric helps understand the pricing dynamics and fare affordability in different areas.

5. Average Fare per Driver by City Type: By dividing the total fares by the total number of drivers, the average fare per driver can be calculated for each city type. This metric provides insights into the earning potential and efficiency of drivers in different areas.

These summary metrics help provide a comprehensive understanding of the PyBer ride data and can be used to analyze the performance, revenue, and market dynamics across different city types.
